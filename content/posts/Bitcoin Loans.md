If you believe that Bitcoin will increase in value, it is essential you never sell.

2024- Bitcoin = $1m 
When this is sold, capital gains will take at minimum %15. If in top bracket, taxes will take ~50%.

Avoid selling Bitcoin for fiat at all costs. Borrow against Bitcoin with no credit check because loan is backed by Bitcoin.

Provide Bitcoin to lender for collateral. They give you USD. $10,000 loan after origination fee is $9,900. Make monthly interest payments with annual rate of 8%. As long as Bitcoin goes up and USD declines, this is ok.


Make Monthly interest payments using
1) Job, rental income
2) Sell small amount of Bitcoin to make interest payment (least desirable, owe taxes on Bitcoin)

If you borrow against bitcoin for real estate property; 2 properties, 1 to rent and 1 to live in. Interest payments on Bitcoin are tax deductible. This will turn Bitcoin into cash generating asset.

When you buy a house, you put down 20% and bank puts down 80% in form of a mortgage. When you put down a Bitcoin, you are putting down a bearer asset with no debt.
