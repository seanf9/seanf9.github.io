Imagine I have a business(only accepting Bitcoin) and you have crude oil. Others negotiate in USD. The two of us make a deal; We price all crude oil in Bitcoin. I purchase all crude oil in Bitcoin and you reinvest all that Bitcoin in my business. People negotiating in dollars, must convert their USD to Bitcoin to purchase oil. That Bitcoin gets reinvested virtually guaranteeing the value of Bitcoin increases.

In this scenario, the price of Bitcoin increases and the value of USD declines. Needless to say, my business will outperform all other investments.

When we factor in inflation, all of my assets increase disproportionally to other assets, especially USD.



This scenario has played out the last 50 years with USD, but now it is starting to break down as USD has become less powerful. Foreign countries are less willing to purchase US Treasuries, leading the Fed to print more USD to continue purchasing Treasuries. The Fed will be forced to continue this trend, devaluing USD. Any attempt at decreasing these purchases will cause a market crash. Economists have been able to hide inflation with the decreasing prices in technology, but CPI will continue to grow as confidence in the dollar declines. Asset prices increase as purchasing power declines.

As Fed prints more USD to purchase Treasuries, USD is debased.
